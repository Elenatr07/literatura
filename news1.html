              <p class="txt_news">05.06.2023</p>
              <p class="txt_news">SpectrumWise Ltd. announces the start of the work on “SpectrumWise Literature”, SpectrumWise’s newest venture; a project that looks to provide a one-stop solution for e-book publishing and sales, aimed at stimulating growth within the industry by offering an alternative route for new writers to have their stories published online. SpectrumWise is building a Product-Service System (PSS) that will enable writers to publish and sell their work as e-books. Their team of experienced writers, designers, and branding experts want to offer their guidance, encouragement, and promotion to new writers through every step of the publishing process; as well as produce interactive and customised content to promote the e-books across a multitude of social media platforms. Their commitment to writer-centricity is what sets them apart from others in the industry, as they strive to be the go-to partner for writers keen to become published authors.
              </p>
              <p class="txt_news"> When asked about her motivations behind this development of a new style of publishing platform, SpectrumWise CEO Irina Turkina stated:</p>
            <span class="txt_news_span">“I’m concerned about the current situation where the corporate world is killing creativity and artistry. Many gifted people are unable to share their work due to financial limitations or lack of marketing skills - and that does not seem right to me! I want to change this - I want to allow creatives to further develop their craft without having to worry about the corporate aspects. I want to utilise SpectrumWise Literature to celebrate creativity and create an environment that values new talent.”</span>
           <p class="txt_news">The SpectrumWise team feels the frustrations of creatives searching for a way to break into the publishing industry. The last few years have seen a dramatic transition in how readers are choosing to consume media; what with Covid-19 causing the closure of many book retailers and e-books replacing print copies as the most popular reading medium. More than that, the rise of international competition has added extra strain to the publishing process for local writers. This switch in the market has ultimately added to the existing barriers that restrict writers’ opportunities; SpectrumWise Literature aims to change that!</p>

           <p class="txt_news"><span class="txt_news_span"> SpectrumWise Ltd.</span>is a full-service creative agency based in London, UK, founded in October of 2022. Since the company began, they have provided high-quality services to both individuals and organisations to build and maintain visual identity, strengthen network connections, and enhance online presence, largely through website design and marketing.</p>
